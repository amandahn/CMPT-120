_**Final Project: Machine Learning for Prediction**_

A program which utilizes the scikit-learn library to take a sample and predict values for the population. Calculates the percentage error of the machine generated and actual data, and visualizes this by showing how many values are within a certain range of error (e.g., how many generated values were within 10% of the actual data, 20%, 30%, etc.). Visualizations were done via bar graph drawings using the Turtle library and colourized for more comprehensive viewing. This program includes an interactive user interface and uses .csv files as input data. 

_**Assignment 5: Vaccination Analysis**_

A program which takes user input to read a .csv file to analyze vaccination information worldwide. Part 1 returns the vaccinated percentage of the entire world. Part 2 returns the the vaccination percentage of a chosen country, worldwide vaccination average, country with lowest vaccinated population, and country with highest vaccinated population.
